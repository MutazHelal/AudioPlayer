## AudioPlayer
Audio player with features like playlists, skip, shuffle, pause and play. React, Next.js, Typescript, and Postgres. Cookies, database schemas, migrations, and API calls with serverless functions.

**Note:** Due to the increase in the cost to host a database on Heroku($10/month from it being free), sign-in auth does not currently work. I might bring it back in the future or feel free to fork and add it yourself (: 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
